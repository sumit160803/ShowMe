this is the readme file for ShowMe

Created a session-based video chatroom where users can join a video call using a common room key. Utilized the Agora SDK to implement video streaming services and primarily used Django for backend development, including the admin panel, database management, and URL routing. As a web application, the frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Through this project, I learned how to effectively use Django for backend management, integrate JavaScript scripts with Django, and utilize the Agora SDK for video calling functionality.

I took the help from a youtuber DENNIS IVY to built this project.
